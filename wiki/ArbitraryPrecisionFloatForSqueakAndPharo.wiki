= Details =

What do you need to play with ArbitraryPrecisionFloat in Squeak or Pharo?
  * install a [http://squeak.org/ Squeak] or [http://pharo-project.org/ Pharo] virtual machine and image (refer to instructions on the respective sites)
  * open the Squeak/Pharo image
  * from there, open a Monticello browser
  * from there, add a Monticello HTTP repository pointing on http://www.squeaksource.com/ArbitraryPrecisionFl, and open the repository
  * from there download a version of the packages ArbitraryPrecisionFloat and ArbitraryPrecisionFloatTests from this repository (you might want to check http://www.squeaksource.com/ArbitraryPrecisionFl.html for revision history).
  * Then, refer to [UsingArbitraryPrecisionFloat] to get a short introduction about usage.

Note that the package is expected to work on Squeak trunk but also back to Squeak 3.9 and possibly earlier, and thus also on all flavours of Pharo to date.
