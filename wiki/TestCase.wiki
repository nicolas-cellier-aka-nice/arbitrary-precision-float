= Introduction =

In Smalltalk SUnit framework, a TestCase is place for holding a suite of unit test cases.


= Details =

TestCase is a class providing testing messages, mainly *#assert: #deny: #should: #shouldnt: #should:raise: #shouldnt:raise:*. It provides support for trapping exceptions and collecting results of the test suites. The SUnit framework then provides a user interface for driving the tests, displaying and debugging the failures. 

A specific test suite is usually implemented by subclassing TestCase, and ArbitraryPrecisionFloatTests is thus a subclass of TestCase.
